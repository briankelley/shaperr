Traffic shaping for Plex Media Server
=======




Supported platforms (so far): Ubuntu Linux 12.04+

##What's the matter with Plex?
* No server-side control over quality settings chosen by Plex clients.

*Your 10mbit Internet uplink is brought to its knees when Mom "direct streams" the full HD video of little Suzi's soccer game.*

* Chunked buffering of Plex clients.

*So, you've managed to convince your outside friends and family to lower their quality settings to something respectable. But when they stream transcoded video, it's delivered to the client in incremental "chunks" at whatever your line speed is. So, for a 1Mbps video, it will max out a 4Mbps pipe 25% of the time and spend the other 75% idling. If you use the same connection for gaming, lag spikes = death.*
